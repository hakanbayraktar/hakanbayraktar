# About me:

## 🚀 Professional Summary

After working for many years in **IT operations and IT management roles**, I have been focusing for the **last five years** on **DevOps practices and cloud technologies**, including **AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform**.

I work with cloud infrastructure, container platforms, and CI/CD pipelines, with a strong focus on **practical, hands-on implementation** and operational reliability.  
In parallel, I also deliver **hands-on, practice-oriented training** in DevOps and cloud fundamentals, which helps me maintain a structured, best-practice-driven approach.

I am especially interested in working in **well-defined, security-conscious, and production-grade environments**, where I can continue to grow as a cloud engineer and contribute reliably as part of a team.
